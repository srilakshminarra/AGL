 Programming challenge

A json web service has been set up at the url: http://agl-developer-test.azurewebsites.net/people.json

Need to write some code to consume the json and output a list of all the cats in alphabetical order under a heading of the gender of their owner.

I have done the code in two technologies. One is in Java and the other is in Angular 

## Java

Run the code on eclipse with IDK 1.6 or later and related jar files.

## Angular 

# With VisualStudio Code 

Run directly on the VSCode. The result appears on http://localhost:4200/

# With CommandPrompt

Get to the directory where code is placed and use the command:

ng -serve

Once the code is compiled,the results comes in the localhost url http://localhost:4200/
